# Collection of 2025 JavaScript testing questions

This repository is a collection of javascript questions from basic to difficult. There are many things that can be learned by solving each question. The purpose of this repository is to improve your logic and experience in working on each javascript question. This repository will continue to be updated every time we find questions that have never been discussed in this repository.

We will also provide a way to solve the problem through our YouTube. Source: https://youtube.com/@dachi-studio

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
   `git clone https://github.com/carollousdev/js-challenges/`
2. Run `npm install`
3. Copy this code before test in the last row of your file. If you see `expect()` you fill with your function. ex: `expect(helloWorld())` and if you see `toBe()` you fill with the answer of question. Ex: `toBe("Hello World!")`:

```js
test("Collection of 2025 Javascript Testing | Dachi Studio", () => {
  expect().toBe();
});
```

4. Rename `code.js` to `code.test.js` according to where the `code.js` file is located.
5. Run `npm run test`
